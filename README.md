# Talk to My Data

**Talk to My Data** delivers a seamless **talk-to-your-data** experience, transforming files, spreadsheets, and cloud data into actionable insights. Simply upload data, connect to Snowflake or BigQuery, or access datasets from DataRobot's Data Registry. Then, ask a question, and the agent recommends business analyses, generating **charts, tables, and even code** to help you interpret the results.

This intuitive experience is designed for **scalability and flexibility**, ensuring that whether you're working with a few thousand rows or billions, your data analysis remains **fast, efficient, and insightful**.

> [!WARNING]
> Application templates are intended to be starting points that provide guidance on how to develop, serve, and maintain AI applications.
> They require a developer or data scientist to adapt and modify them for their business requirements before being put into production.

## Quick Start

Please check out this [Talk To My Data walkthrough](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/get-started/gs-dr5/talk-data-walk.html).

## Setup

Before proceeding, ensure you have access to the required credentials and services. This template is pre-configured to use an Azure OpenAI endpoint and Snowflake Database credentials. To run the template as-is, you will need access to Azure OpenAI (leverages `gpt-4o` by default).

**Prerequisites:** If you are using DataRobot Codespaces, this is already complete for you. If not, install:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (Python package manager)
- [Taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) (task runner)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 18+ (for React frontend)
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/) (infrastructure as code)

**DataRobot Codespaces users:** If you opened this template from the [Application Templates gallery](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/workbench/wb-apps/app-templates/index.html#application-templates), you can **skip steps 1 and 2**. If you created a fresh codespace, you can **skip step 1** but still need to **clone the repository (step 2)**.

**For local development,** follow all of the following steps:

1. If `pulumi` is not already installed, install the CLI following instructions [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/).
   After installing for the first time, restart your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   pulumi login --local  # omit --local to use Pulumi Cloud (requires separate account)
   ```

2. Clone the template repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/datarobot-community/talk-to-my-data-agent.git
   cd talk-to-my-data-agent
   ```

3. Rename the file `.env.template` to `.env` in the root directory of the repo and populate your credentials.

   ```bash
   DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN=...
   DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT=...  # e.g. https://app.datarobot.com/api/v2
   OPENAI_API_KEY=...
   OPENAI_API_VERSION=...  # e.g. 2024-02-01
   OPENAI_API_BASE=...  # e.g. https://your_org.openai.azure.com/
   OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_ID=...  # e.g. gpt-4o
   PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE=...  # Required. Choose your own alphanumeric passphrase to be used for encrypting pulumi config
   FRONTEND_TYPE=...  # Optional. Default is "react", set to "streamlit" to use Streamlit frontend
   USE_DATAROBOT_LLM_GATEWAY=...  # Optional. Set to "true" to use DataRobot LLM Gateway with consumption based pricing instead of using your own LLM credentials
   ```

   Use the following resources to locate the required credentials:

   - **DataRobot API Token**: Refer to the _Create a DataRobot API Key_ section of the [DataRobot API Quickstart docs](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/api/api-quickstart/index.html#create-a-datarobot-api-key).
   - **DataRobot Endpoint**: Refer to the _Retrieve the API Endpoint_ section of the same [DataRobot API Quickstart docs](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/api/api-quickstart/index.html#retrieve-the-api-endpoint).
   - **LLM Endpoint and API Key**: Refer to the [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?tabs=command-line%2Cjavascript-keyless%2Ctypescript-keyless%2Cpython-new&pivots=programming-language-python#retrieve-key-and-endpoint).

4. In a terminal, run:

   ```bash
   python quickstart.py YOUR_PROJECT_NAME  # Windows users may have to use `py` instead of `python`
   ```

   **What does `quickstart.py` do?**

   The quickstart script automates the entire setup process for you:

   - Creates and activates a Python virtual environment
   - Installs all required dependencies (using `uv` for faster installation, falling back to `pip`)
   - Loads your `.env` configuration
   - Sets up the Pulumi stack with your project name
   - Runs `pulumi up` to deploy your application
   - Displays your application URL when complete

   This single command replaces all the manual steps described in the [advanced setup section](#setup-for-advanced-users).

   Python 3.10 - 3.12 are supported

Advanced users desiring control over virtual environment creation, dependency installation, environment variable setup
and `pulumi` invocation see [here](#setup-for-advanced-users).

## Template development

The Talk to My Data agent supports two frontend options:

- **React** (default): a modern JavaScript-based frontend with enhanced UI features which uses [FastAPI Backend](app_backend/README.md). See the [React Frontend Development Guide](app_frontend/README.md)
- **Streamlit:** A Python-based frontend with a simple interface. See the [Streamlit Frontend Development Guide](frontend/README.md)

To change the frontend:

1. In `.env`: Set `FRONTEND_TYPE="streamlit"` to use the Streamlit frontend instead of the default React.
2. Run the following to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

## Architecture overview

![image](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/datarobot_public/drx/ttmd2-schematic.jpg)

App templates contain three families of complementary logic:

- **AI logic**: Necessary to service AI requests and produce predictions and completions.
  ```
  deployment_*/  # Chat agent model
  ```
- **App Logic**: Necessary for user consumption; whether via a hosted front-end or integrating into an external consumption layer.
  ```
  frontend/  # Streamlit frontend
  app_frontend/  # React frontend alternative with the api located in app_backend
  utils/  # App business logic & runtime helpers
  ```
- **Operational Logic**: Necessary to activate DataRobot assets.
  ```
  infra/__main__.py  # Pulumi program for configuring DataRobot to serve and monitor AI and app logic
  infra/  # Settings for resources and assets created in DataRobot
  ```

## Why build AI Apps with DataRobot app templates?

App Templates transform your AI projects from notebooks to production-ready applications. Too often, getting models into production means rewriting code, juggling credentials, and coordinating with multiple tools and teams just to make simple changes. DataRobot's composable AI apps framework eliminates these bottlenecks, letting you spend more time experimenting with your ML and app logic and less time wrestling with plumbing and deployment.

- Start building in minutes: Deploy complete AI applications instantly, then customize the AI logic or the front-end independently (no architectural rewrites needed).
- Keep working your way: Data scientists keep working in notebooks, developers in IDEs, and configs stay isolated. Update any piece without breaking others.
- Iterate with confidence: Make changes locally and deploy with confidence. Spend less time writing and troubleshooting plumbing and more time improving your app.

Each template provides an end-to-end AI architecture, from raw inputs to deployed application, while remaining highly customizable for specific business requirements.

## Data privacy

Your data privacy is important to us. Data handling is governed by the DataRobot [Privacy Policy](https://www.datarobot.com/privacy/), please review before using your own data with DataRobot.

## Make changes

### Change the LLM

1. Modify the `LLM` setting in `infra/settings_generative.py` by changing `LLM=LLMs.AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_4_O` to any other LLM from the `LLMs` object.
   - Trial users: Please set `LLM=LLMs.AZURE_OPENAI_GPT_4_O_MINI` since GPT-4o is not supported in the trial. Use the `OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_ID` in `.env` to override which model is used in your Azure organization. You'll still see GPT 4o-mini in the playground, but the deployed app will use the provided Azure deployment.
2. To use an existing TextGen model or deployment:
   - In `infra/settings_generative.py`: Set `LLM=LLMs.DEPLOYED_LLM`.
   - In `.env`: Set either the `TEXTGEN_REGISTERED_MODEL_ID` or the `TEXTGEN_DEPLOYMENT_ID`
   - In `.env`: Set `CHAT_MODEL_NAME` to the model name expected by the deployment (e.g. "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" for an anthropic deployment,"datarobot-deployed-llm" for NIM models )
   - (Optional) In `utils/api.py`: `ALTERNATIVE_LLM_BIG` and `ALTERNATIVE_LLM_SMALL` can be used for fine-grained control over which LLM is used for different tasks.

### Use [DataRobot LLM Gateway](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/gen-ai/genai-code/dr-llm-gateway.html)

The application supports using the DataRobot LLM Gateway instead of bringing your own LLM credentials.

#### **Credential Priority**

The application follows this priority order for LLM selection:

1. **OpenAI Credentials** (Highest Priority) - If `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`, etc. are provided in `.env`, they will always be used regardless of the `USE_DATAROBOT_LLM_GATEWAY` setting
2. **LLM Gateway** - If `USE_DATAROBOT_LLM_GATEWAY=true` and no OpenAI credentials are provided

#### **Setup**

**Important**: Remove or comment out `OPENAI_*` environment variables to use DataRobot's LLM Gateway

1. In `.env`: Set `USE_DATAROBOT_LLM_GATEWAY=true`
2. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

#### **When LLM Gateway is enabled:**

- No hardcoded LLM credentials (OpenAI keys) are required in your `.env` file
- The LLM Gateway provides a unified interface to multiple LLM providers through DataRobot in production
- You can pick from the catalog and change the model `LLM` in `infra/settings_generative.py`
- It will use a DataRobot Guarded RAG Deployment and LLM Blueprint for that selected model

**Note**: LLM Gateway mode requires consumption based pricing is enabled for your DataRobot account as is evidenced by the `ENABLE_LLM_GATEWAY` feature flag.
Contact your administrator if this feature is not available.

1. In `.env`: If not using an existing TextGen model or deployment, provide the required credentials dependent on your choice.
2. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

> **⚠️ Availability information:**
> Using a NIM model requires custom model GPU inference, a premium feature. You will experience errors by using this type of model without the feature enabled. Contact your DataRobot representative or administrator for information on enabling this feature.

### Change the database

#### Snowflake

To add Snowflake support:

1. Modify the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE` setting in `infra/settings_database.py` by changing `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "no_database"` to `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "snowflake"`.
2. Provide snowflake credentials in `.env` by either setting `SNOWFLAKE_USER` and `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` or by setting `SNOWFLAKE_KEY_PATH` to a file containing the key. The key file should be a `*.p8` private key file. (see [Snowflake Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth))
3. Fill out the remaining snowflake connection settings in `.env` (refer to `.env.template` for more details)
4. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

#### BigQuery

The Talk to my Data Agent supports connecting to BigQuery.

1. Modify the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE` setting in `infra/settings_database.py` by changing `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "no_database"` to `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "bigquery"`.
2. Provide the required google credentials in `.env` dependent on your choice. Ensure that GOOGLE_DB_SCHEMA is also populated in `.env`.
3. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

#### SAP Datasphere

The Talk to my Data Agent supports connecting to SAP Datasphere.

1. Modify the `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE` setting in `infra/settings_database.py` by changing `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "no_database"` to `DATABASE_CONNECTION_TYPE = "sap"`.
2. Provide the required SAP credentials in `.env`.
3. Run `pulumi up` to update your stack (Or run `python quickstart.py` for easier setup)
   ```bash
   source set_env.sh  # On Windows use `set_env.bat`
   pulumi up
   ```

## Tools

You can help the data analyst python agent by providing tools that can assist with data analysis tasks. For that, define functions in `utils/tools.py`. The function will be made available inside the code execution environment of the agent. The name, docstring and signature will be provided to the agent inside the prompt.

## Share results

1. Log into the DataRobot application.
2. Navigate to **Registry > Applications**.
3. Navigate to the application you want to share, open the actions menu, and select **Share** from the dropdown.

## Delete all provisioned resources

```bash
pulumi down
```

## Setup for advanced users

For manual control over the setup process adapt the following steps for MacOS/Linux to your environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
source set_env.sh
pulumi stack init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
pulumi up
```

e.g. for Windows/conda/cmd.exe this would be:

```bash
conda create --prefix .venv pip
conda activate .\.venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
set_env.bat
pulumi stack init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
pulumi up
```

For projects that will be maintained, DataRobot recommends forking the repo so upstream fixes and improvements can be merged in the future.
